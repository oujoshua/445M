Driver board: PWM motor control, tachometers, execute movement commands: PID or other controller trying to match actual speed to desired speed, ethernet packets send new desired speeds

Sensor board: Decision making, sensor inputs, sends movement commands (turn left, go straight, ect)
	Sensor inputs: Pings, IR: periodically measure 10-15 times per second (limited by speed of ping sensor)
	Decision making: whether to go straight or turn
	Periodically trigger measurements. Foreground thread repeatedly waits on measurements to complete (with semaphores). Once a new         set of measurements comes in, figure out what to do next (turn, keep going)
