1) If the UART is interrupt driven, than unpredictable high-priority interrupts
   will increase the jitter.

3) DAS: priority 1; ADC: priority 3; Button: priority 2; SysTick: priority 7.
   The reason behind these priorities is to give the real-time tasks the highest
   priorities to minimize jitter.

5) The OS_Kill() statements at the end of Consumer and Display should always
   be executed, as once the ADC has sampled enough data via Producer they should
   exit their while() loops and then execute OS_Kill(). However, based on
   observation, this doesn't always happen.

 7) Based on the length of the timeslice, it is unlikely that Consumer ever
    waits on OS_MailBoxSend, as it has to wait for 64 samples from the ADC and
    then compute the FFT from them inbetween calls. As long as a thread switch
    happens during that time, allowing Display to empty the mailbox, it won't
    have to wait.
